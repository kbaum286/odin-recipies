    <h2>How to make the best lemonade</h2>
    <p1><ul>Ingredients for about 6 servings:</ul></p1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 cups white sugar (preferably superfine sugar)</li>
        <li>6 meyers lemons (preferably from a farmers market to save yourself from having to de-wax them)</li>
        <li>5 cups cold water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of room temperature water</li>
    </ul>
    <p1><ul>Steps:</ul></p1>
    <ol>
        <li>Start off by preparing the lemons, if they are from a store they probably have a thin wax coating.  Because we are extracting the oils from the peel it is best to de-wax them first, by placing them in a colander and pouring boiling water over them, then quickly rubbing them with a brush or paper towel.  Immediately afterwards run cool water over them to cool them back off.</li>
        <li>Now, you must peel the lemons with a potato peeler (or paring knife), carefully trying to avoid taking the white part of the peel as it would add a bitter taste.  Place them into a bowl or freezer bag.</li>
        <li>Now measure out 1 1/4 cup of superfine sugar (also called baker's sugar or castor sugar).  If you do not have any super fine sugar, you can make your own from granulated white sugar using a coffee grinder or food processor.  It sould only take 2-3 pulses to make it fine enough, but not too fine like powdered sugar.  Then it will work the best for absorbing the oils.</li>
        <li>Pour the sugar over the lemon zest, toss to combine, then muddle with a masher, pestle, large spoon etc to help get the process started.  Then place it in the fridge and wait at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Juice the lemons!  There are a variety of ways to juice lemons, if you don't have a juicer you can roll them around on a flat surface with your hand to soften them up then use a fork or spoon as a "juicer".  Alternatively, if you have a blender and want to keep the pulp, you can peel them like an orange and remove the seeds from the wedges with a pointy knife then pop them into the blender.</li>
        <li>Take that bowl of sugar and lemon peel and see if the sugar is fully dissolved.  If not, add a 1/4 cup of boiling water to help it dissolve.  Then add a little more and so on, but there shouldn't be more than a 1:1 ratio of water to sugar.  An alternative method, instead of boiling water, is to add the lemon juice too the sugar /peel mix to help the sugar dissolve.  You can try adding the juice from all 6 lemons.</li>
        <li>Finally, add the lemon juice to the cold water and add the sugary syrup to taste.  I prefer a little less sweet.</li>
